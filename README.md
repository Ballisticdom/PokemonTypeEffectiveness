# PokemonTypeEffectiveness
My nephews and friends have recently gotten into Pokémon but don't know all of the names and what types are good against what. 
This python program will print out the types are good/bad against a Pokémon. 
This data is based on Pokemon Go, not the mainline series games.
Things like immunities and the traditional 2x, 4x, 1/2x, etc damage are not applicable and the math is a little different.
